        Metric in the Curve Complex
        
        The curve complex is a simplicial complex composed of vertices representing equivalency classes of isotopic 
        simple closed curves on a surface of fixed genus and of edges drawn between vertices if classes contain a disjoint 
        representative. MICC is a tool designed to compute short distances between these disjoint representatives, based 
        on an intuitive disk-with-handles represntation of a surface.
        
        Example useage of MICC:
        
        <pre><code>
        from curves import curvePair
        
        top    = [21,7,8,9,10,11,22,23,24,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]
        bottom = [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,1,2,3,4,5,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,0,6,7,8]
        test = curvePair(top, bottom)
        print test.distance
        
        </pre></code>
